gem 'fastlane-plugin-bundletool', '1.0.4'

## About bundletool

**bundletool** is the underlying tool that Gradle, Android Studio, and Google Play use to build an Android App Bundle or convert an app bundle into the various APKs that are deployed to devices. bundletool is also available to you as a command line tool, so you can recreate, inspect, and verify Google Play’s server-side build of your app’s APKs.

The motivation of this plugin is to extract an universal `.apk` file from an [.aab](https://fileinfo.com/extension/aab) file. Since we cannot distribute aab files, it's great that we can extract from the very same binary a file that we can distribute internally.

## Usage

In your Fastfile you need to use `bundletool` action. After you build the `.aab` file you can run the following code.

```ruby
bundletool(
  ks_path: keystore_path,
  ks_password: keystore_password,
  ks_key_alias: keystore_alias,
  ks_key_alias_password: keystore_alias_password,
  bundletool_version: '1.9.0',
  aab_path: aab_path,
  apk_output_path: apk_output_path,
  verbose: true
)
```

This will output the universal `.apk` in the output path you set.

## Use case

Here you can find a post I did explaining why I have to create this action.
